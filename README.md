# SecureFlow – A Secure CI/CD Pipeline with Integrated Secret Scanning

## Project Overview

SecureFlow is a DevSecOps project that demonstrates how a secure Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline can be implemented using GitHub Actions.

The goal of this project is to automate the process of building and testing code, and in later phases, integrate secret scanning to prevent deployment of insecure code containing sensitive information such as API keys or passwords.
